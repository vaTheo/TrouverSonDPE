# Backend of GeoNote

The project is an innovative website that allows users to obtain a score out of 100 for a specific address. This score is calculated using various relevant data retrieved via public and open source APIs. These data include, among others, water quality, geographical risks, and meteorological data related to the entered address. In addition to simply retrieving data, these are also available for visualization on the site, allowing users to understand the different scores assigned and to study any potential issues associated with the analyzed address. This feature forms the core of the site.

# Development

This project is still under development, but a release has been shipped to geonote.fly.dev
